### Why did i do it? 
I really likes how does look original Osprey, but it is very difficult to assemble it yourself. This remix allows you to build it much easier and it still can be wireless! However, the assembly is not the easiest due to the size of the diodes.
### What changed? 
It uses SuperMini as controller. I used original PCB as template, so outline barely changed to fit a MSK swtich near USB-port. I have to slightly change case usb-hole and add a switch cutout. But original plate still fits. 
### Thanks
Huge thanks to the [ebastler](https://github.com/ebastler), author of the [original project](https://github.com/ebastler/osprey) for the inspiration and for the great work he did on the original project and [aroum](https://github.com/aroum) for his kind help and advices.
